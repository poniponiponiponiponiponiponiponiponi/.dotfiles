# .dotfiles
My dotfiles and other configuration related things. Not a lot of things but I
don't want to search for the same things every time I reinstall my system
either. I use simlinks even though I know about the git --bare trick for
storing dotfiles. I like the separation between everything in my git directory
and everything else so I don't use it.
